<h1>My Snakes!</h1>
<h3>Different version of snakes i wrote, by different tools; all in C++</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, The version 3 of these snakes is pushed in my pya-h account,<br>
I found it interesting to put this one here too.</p>
<hr />
<p>Since when I look through these codes, I see myself from 11/12 years ago, when I first started to <span style="background:purple">really program sth, by learning C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its interesting for me, How my coding style changes through years. Got me thinking about the changes i experienced outside of computers too. Its like These piece of song:</p>
<pre>
        What's coming through is alive
        What's holding up is a mirror
        But what's singing songs is a snake, it is
        Looking to turn my piss to wine
        They're both totally void of hate
        And killing me just the same
        The snake behind me hisses
        What my damage could have been
        My blood before me begs me
        Open up my heart again
        And I feel this coming over like a storm again
        Considerately
        Venomous voice, tempts me
        And drains me, bleeds me
        Leaves me cracked and empty
        Drags me down like some sweet gravity ...
